**React Context Practice**

In this exercise you have to:

<> Create a React Context providing information about an arbitrary item

<> Wrap the parent component with the context provider

<> Obtain item information in components through Context

<> Edit item information in components through Context


The solution can be considered successful if the output changes alongside the input and the result is achieved using React Context API.
**Do not pass props directly from parent to children elements**
